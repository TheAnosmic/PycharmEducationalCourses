When something go wrong, Exception should be thrown in the script.
Exceptions can be caught using a try block like this:
<!-- blockquote not really doing anything, and "&#09;" is tab -->
<blockquote>
    try:<br>
        &#09;do_something_that_might_fail()<br>
    except:<br>
        &#09;print("something did fail")<br>
</blockquote>
